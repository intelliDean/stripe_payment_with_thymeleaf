# Integration of Stripe Payment Gateway
I have experience integrating the Stripe payment gateway into Spring Boot projects. In a previous project, I used the Stripe SDK to allow users to make secure and seamless payments on the platform. I am unable to share the code from that project because it is in production, but I have created a new project to demonstrate how to integrate the Stripe SDK into a Spring Boot project.

### Features
* User Registration: Users can register and are automatically registered as customers on Stripe. This enables easy payment.
* Product Registration: When payment is to be made, it will be for a particular product or service. Stripe allows products/services to be created, so when a product/service is created on the platform, it is also created on Stripe.
* User Retrieval: Users can be retrieved.
* User Deletion: Users can be deleted.
* Payment Intent Creation: Payment intents can be created before charges are made.


### Installation
* Clone the repository or download it as a zip file.
* Configure the database and the secret.properties file.
* Build and run the application.

### Technologies Used
* Java
* Spring Boot
* MySQL
* Thymeleaf
